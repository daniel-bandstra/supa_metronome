Supa Metronome: A Responsive Metronome for the Adafruit EdgeBadge

I wanted a metronome as nice and basic as my trusty Seiko SQ50-V, but with some extra magical properties. These properties included: BPM settings lower than 40, the ability to play patterns other than steady quarter notes, a one-measure quarter-note count before repeating the pattern indefinitely, and the ability to click randomly but in-time with the beat. My slightly less basic Teenage Engineering PO-12 could do some of these things, but not enough of them. I figured the best way was to program a gadget in Arduino. The best way to make an interface to that gadget was to buy an Adafruit EdgeBadge. I went for the EdgeBadge because I thought the built-in microphone could come in useful and I was right.
